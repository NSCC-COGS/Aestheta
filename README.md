<i>Let's get this thing rolling!</i>

Starting out: lets have a look at the previous tutorials from GDA2030 to get an idea where we can begin. There we can learn some [basics of using google colab](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/tree/master/tutorial1), we can see some [basic image loading examples in python](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial1/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T1_kevinmc.ipynb), see an example of [accessing landsat data](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial2/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T2_kevinmc_getLandsat.ipynb), see some more [advanced image maniuplation](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial4/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T4_kevinmc.ipynb) techniques, and finally get an example of [building a model in scikitlearn](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial5/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T5_kevinmc.ipynb).

let's do this!
