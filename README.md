<i>Let's get this thing rolling!</i>

Starting out: lets have a look at the previous tutorials from GDA2030 to get an idea where we can begin. There we can learn some [basics of using google colab](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/tree/master/tutorial1), we can see some [basic image loading examples in python](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial1/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T1_kevinmc.ipynb), see an example of [accessing landsat data](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial2/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T2_kevinmc_getLandsat.ipynb), see some more [advanced image maniuplation](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial4/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T4_kevinmc.ipynb) techniques, and finally get an example of [building a model in scikitlearn](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial5/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T5_kevinmc.ipynb).

let's do this!

Check out our latest ['Hello Earth'](/Experiments/Hello_Earth.ipynb) satellite classification and other weird tests in our [experiments](/Experiments) section... 

# Earth is Special
We're teaching an AI to understand what it means to be looking at our lovely planet.

There is lots of great data available and tools we can use! Early results are very promising.
