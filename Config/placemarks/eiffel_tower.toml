# This is the default zoom level for this placemark â€” a zoom level that shows
# the placemark at an appropriate scale. If the placemark is a landmark, the
# zoom level will probably be high; if the placemark is a whole city, the zoom
# level will be much lower.
#
# You can override this default zoom level by specifying one explicitly when
# you ask for a tile.
#
# The default zoom level is optional, but if you leave it out, you'll need to
# specify the zoom level explicitly when you ask for a tile based on this
# placemark.

# The name of the placemark is based on the name of the file, minus the
# '.toml' suffix.
#
# This placemark's name will be 'eiffel_tower', so we can refer
# to it in code as Placemark.get('eiffel_tower').
#
# Aliases let us refer to the placemark by other names, so we can also refer to
# this placemark in code as Placemark.get('eiffel') or
# Placemark.get('eiffel tower').
#
# Aliases are optional: you can always look up the placemark by its 'official'
# name.
