ESRI has a hub with cool GeoAI projects including:
    Object extraction from mobile lidar with ML
    Monitoring traffic flow using deep learning
    Change detection of structures in panchromatic imagery

Note to Kevin and all:
After eelgrass project is complete, should we consider mimicking one of these projects to learn the workflow?
